			<summary>Lanes</summary>
			New Business - “Unrefined material” - Must have a potential due date.
			Announcements for the next meeting
			Problems with no defined solution
			Unidentified “complaints” 
			Unplanned - “Work that has been touched and defined but not been assigned”
			Contains a due-date, at least 1 associated team member, goals that can be completed in 1 “cycle” - where a cycle is defined as the time between team standups.
			Blocked - Blocked items cannot be actioned until the block is resolved.
			Blocked card must have a clearly defined unblock task
			Possibly send alerts to slack / notify team or manager
			Responsibility Lanes (Planned Work) - “Lane per group, for defining workload”
			Workload should be broken out by generalized types of work done by the team.
			On an assembly line you might separate bolting parts together from painting the car.
			Capacity of lane should be estimated by 
			$number_of_workers * $work_they_can_reasonably complete_in_a_cycle
			Tracked but not Blocking Lane(s) - “Lane per project or team which is not blocking”
			Kept for information or progress such as Onboarding and Offboarding.
			Complete - “Finished and kept in a lane for the month until it is archived”
			Cards need somewhere to go after they’re completed.
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Implicit Rules</summary>
			All work enters at the New Business lane.
			All work moves between lanes during a standup*
			Transactions are not Work.

			* It’s OK to add comments, change members and provide possible solutions to cards, but NOT ok to move them between meetings.  All cards should move through lanes at the standup.

			<summary>The Process</summary>
			

			The Process
			Users populate to the New Business between cycles
			Card Master for the week reviews lanes before meeting.
			Looking for missing information on New Business items
			Comparing unplanned work for the coming week to estimated capacity in each lane.
			Pushing unplanned work due dates where possible
			Following up with team members individually to fix placeholder cards and confirm changes in 
			Clear any cards in New Business
			Determine if a card is:
			Announcement (No action needed)
			Complaint (Card should be reworked)
			See “1-minute redirect”
			A Transaction - Transactions are problems with well defined solutions.  These should not be processed.
			Problem (Solutions should be suggested!)
			Collaborate solutions to the card
			Define the problem as well as possible
			Brainstorm a TODO list of items that can be completed in a cycle
			Now is NOT the time to solve the problem
			See “1-minute goals”
			$ESTIMATE_POKER_PLACEHOLDER
			Move to Unplanned
			Move any finished cards to Complete
			Review cards marked as completed
			This is a chance for discussion and praise
			See 1-minute manager “1 minute praise”
			As part of the review of completed work - 
			Consider any new work that resulted.
			Consider if this class of problem can now be transactional
			  See “Andon cord”
			Review work Planned for the current cycle
			Determine if work is blocked
			Determine if work is expected to be completed by the start of next cycle, or if due date needs to be updated.
			Team member responsible for the card should ultimately determine the timeline. 
			External pressures such as other work that is blocked or external deadlines should be considered.
			Any card with a new due date past the next cycle, should be moved back to Unplanned.
			Ensure all cards have a touch / comment / due date adjustment by end of cycle.

			Drain Unplanned work due before next cycle
			Move any work due within the next cycle to the appropriate lane
			Decide if any lane is overloaded, adjust if possible

			End the Meeting.
			There should be a defined and concise step to end the meeting.
			This prevents end of meeting add-ons and off topic discussion. 
			Team building is great - but stand-ups aren't the time.

			<summary>Exceptions</summary>
			Stale Cards and Punts
			Stale cards, sometimes the result of punts, are cards that perpetually miss completion.

			Punts occur when a card is promised, but moved to a future date without being blocked. 
			Punts occur during the planning meeting for the next cycle, or the current cycle review.
			If a card is punted ahead of the next cycle, it should be moved back to unplanned.

			The goal of a cardmaster, as well as a team, is to keep the unplanned work lane as small as possible. At the same time, the bar for adding unplanned work by any team member should be low; team members should never feel they have to defend their card past the first occasion of new business. 

			Suggested stale card resolution practices:
			Just as the team member(s) presenting a card should be responsible for completion, only team members involved with a card should be responsible for archiving or removal of stale cards. 
			At the start of a planning cycle meeting - ask team members to tag for archive any card they submitted that they feel no longer needs to be addressed.
			Important note: Team members should not archive other members submissions.
			Create a custom field for “Times Punted” - force review after 3 punts
			Metrics of interest from punted cards:
			Punts per week could indicate a busy or overly ambitious week.
			Cards with 3 or more punts could indicate a poorly defined work item.

			Thoughts for next time
